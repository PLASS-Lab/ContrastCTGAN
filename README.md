## Overview
This project, **ContrastCTGAN**, is an end-to-end deep learning framework designed to enhance non-contrast computed tomography (CT) images for improved pulmonary embolism identification. By using a generative adversarial network (GAN), the framework generates enhanced CT images to facilitate more accurate diagnostic capabilities and clinical research advancements in medical imaging.
